# What is hook

Hook is something like a bookmark manager but far more robust as it allows context-aware bookmarking and linking. You can read more about hook 
[here](https://hookproductivity.com).

# What are the scripts in this repository

These scripts are used by Hook to access content of certains apps. All of them are base on what is accessible either in the app or at the Hook forum, 
but slightly enhanced to work for me. For example, the build-in Things3 script did not fetch the project name if the project was just selected on the 
left-side pane. So you had to select e.g. the project name (put you cursor there) for the Hook to recognize it. It the Things 3 script in this repo this 
has been addressed.

As for the [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [DataSpell](https://www.jetbrains.com/dataspell/) scripts - I just used the built-in 
Intellij script and tweaked to work reliably without clearing your clipboard.

# How do I use these scripts

Hook has a very detailed tutorial page [here](https://hookproductivity.com/help/integration/creating-integration-scripts/).
